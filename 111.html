            <h1>Chapter 16. The Ship.</h1>
          </header>
          <p>In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to
            understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two
            or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the
            whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that
            the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to
            do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for
            all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the
            present irrespective of Queequeg.</p>
          <p>I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s
            judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of
            god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.</p>
          <p>Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at
            all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our
            fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and
            accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should
            quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little
            bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
            Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I
            never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo
            warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged
            sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years’ voyages—The
            Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you
            will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient
            Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board
            the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.</p>
          <p>You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese
            junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this
            same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned
            claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her
            old hull’s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her
            venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
            overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient
            decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled.
            But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that
            for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded
            another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old
            Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over,
            with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler
            or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished
            ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her
            enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp
            teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran
            not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel
            at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long
            narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the
            Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All
            noble things are touched with that.</p>
